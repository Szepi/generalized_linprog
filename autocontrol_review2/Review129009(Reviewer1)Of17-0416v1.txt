The work is, as I said previously, good as it goves a nice theoretical
analysis. The introduction is a pretty nice review and a succinct
summary of this line of work in MDPs.

Nevertheless, the writing of the main body is still difficult to
follow. The authors may further work on simplifying the manuscript
presentation. 
Though they have explained almost all the assumption in intuitive way
now, so I am satisfied with the authors response.


Though I do not think that the experiments in the paper represent a
main part of the contribution, this section seems weak with respect to
the rest of the contribution and the setup could be explained  in a
better way.

I think the paper is ready with minor modifications.
