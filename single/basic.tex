\begin{align}\label{mdplp}
\begin{split}
\min_{J\in \R^n} \,&c^\top J\\
\text{s.t.}\mb &J(s)\geq g_a(s)+\alpha\sum_{s'}p_a(s,s')J(s'), \mb s\in S, a \in A,
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $c\in \R^n_+$ is any vector whose components are all non-negative. One can show that $J^*$ is the solution to the LP formulation \eqref{mdplp} \cite{BertB}. 
Also, of the three methods, value iteration and LP formulation are value function based methods, i.e., they compute $J^*$ directly and then $u^*$ is obtained by plugging $J^*$ in \eqref{bellpol}.

While the basic methods (i.e., VI, PI and LP) can be used to compute exact values $J^*$ and $u^*$ for MDPs with a small number of states, they are computationally expensive in the case of MDPs with a large number of states.
