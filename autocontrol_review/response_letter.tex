\opening{\textbf{Dear Editor,}}
We would like to re-submit the revised version of our paper. We now list the differences between the previous and current submission.
\begin{itemize}
\item The title of the paper has been changed to ``A Linearly Relaxed Approximate Linear Program for Markov Decisions Processes''.
\item The length of current draft has been increased to 8 pages.
\item We have incorporated major revisions in the paper and restructure the presentation.
\item The length of the introduction has been increased to make the motivation clear. Proper placement with respect to existing literature has been done.
\item The main result has been stated upfront alongside a discussion.
\item Streamlined formulation of the main result, with additional corollary that illustrates the utility. Added examples.
\item The proof has been simplified and restructured. The constants in the bound have been slightly improved.
\item Numerical illustration: New example has been added to illustrate the choices available when choosing constraints.
\end{itemize}
We have taken care of all the reviewer comments, except for the following comment by Reviewer~$1$.\\
\emph{Comment}: Explain the intuition behind stationary Markov deterministic policies being optimal.\\
\emph{Our Response:} The fact follows from the Markov property. Since we are limited by space, we have added a reference to literature.
