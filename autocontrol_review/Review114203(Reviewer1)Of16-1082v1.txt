The authors have developed a deterministic way to handle LP for MDP and
also new analytic tools for error analysis. Though this article
introduces novel contributions to the field but the writing is a bit
clumsy. Explanations of the lemmas and definitions are missing (as
marked later). The authors don't provide intuition for most of the
assumptions. Since the authors have additional space, more details
should be provided.
Some of the terms in the definitions like discounted maximal inflations
are never used directly and no reasoning behind the use of Lyapunov
stability (which is a good and important part of the technique here) is
given anywhere. For a contribution of this kind such an explanation is
at least expected. So it's better if the authors give some
explanations, elongate it a bit and make it readable to someone who
isn't expert of both control and MDP, otherwise it is a very good piece
of work.

Few detailed comments are attached.
